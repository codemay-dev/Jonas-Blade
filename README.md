# Jonas Blade & Metalworks

This is a WordPress site built for a New Hampshire based bladesmith.

The theme is custom and hand coded by me with no other contributers.

There were professional design mockups created and used to work from in building this project. The design mockups are available to view in the repo.

The live website can be viewed here: https://jonasblade.com
